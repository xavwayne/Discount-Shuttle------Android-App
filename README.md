# Discount-Shuttle-app-for-Android
Generally speaking,Discount Shuttle is designed to collect discount information for customer they are interested in, and to build a platform for seller to attract customer. As a seller, one can simply post the discount information combined with their shopâ€™s location, those data will be send and stored in our server, which is a tomcat server running by a laptop. On the other hand, Discount shuttle allows customer to find their interested discount information close to them.They can get details about the product, the shop, even the way lead to the shop. This idea was generated one day I hang out for dinner with my friends in south side and find a supermarket named ALDI accidentally. I find most of the items there are in discount and nearly half price of those in Giant Eagle where I used to shop. As a student without income, I consider that those information especially discount information can be very important to people like me. they can save lots of money and buy high quality products on the same time.
